Step 1: Grab a glass
Step 2: Fill said glass about half way with ice (cubed or crushed is fine)
Step 3: Fill glass about 7/8's full of Coke (the soda kind not the white powder kind)
Step 4: Fill the remaineder of the glass with Rum (this is the acoholic part)
Step 5: Add lime to taste and enjoy but just don't drive.
